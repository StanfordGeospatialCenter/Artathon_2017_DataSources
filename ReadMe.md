# Geospatial Data & Software Resources for Hackathons

Below you'll find some of the basic building blocks for creating interactive mapping applications for the web of Mobile. About the only thing you need, that you won't find below, is a web server for your html code. 

## The Basics
[http://mapschool.io/](http://mapschool.io/)  

An excellent introduction to mapping with computers, particularly for the web. Mapschool is a collaborative, simple guide to understanding the concepts of cartography, gis, and maps. You can read it at [mapschool.io](mapschool.io) and contribute to it at [https://github.com/mapschool/mapschool](https://github.com/mapschool/mapschool). Mapschool is licensed CC0: it is free.

## Software

#### QGIS
[http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)  
QGIS is the best Open Source Desktop GIS package around. A good place to start for learning to use it is: [http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/)  

#### GDAL  
[http://www.gdal.org/](http://www.gdal.org/)  
GDAL is the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, a command-line set of tools for transforming and converting geospatial datasets.

#### OpenRefine  
[http://openrefine.org/](http://openrefine.org/)  

OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data.  You can also use it in conjunction with geonames.org and other web-based geospatial APIs to geocode and route. See [https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter/Tutorial-Geocoding-APIs](https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter/Tutorial-Geocoding-APIs) for a tutorial on using OpenRefine for geocoding. 

## Online Services  

#### Planet.com

#### Mapbox  
[https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/)  
Mapbox Studio provides a free tier of subscription which iwll allow you to create performant web mapping applications. You can customize the symbology of OpenStreetMap data to your own purpose, add your own operational data, and create custom behaviors in pop-ups, etc...  

#### CARTO  
[https://carto.com/](https://carto.com/)  
CARTO.com is the newest iteration of CartoDB.com, and provides a great deal of developer-friendly geospatial data analysis and management functionality with the free account level.  You can even use CARTO to store non-geo data and call it through the SQL API or the DATA API, for use in websites using D3.js, etc...  

#### OpenStreetMap  
[http://www.openstreetmap.org/](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)  
OpenStreetMa is the crowdsourced map of the world, and one of the most complete sources of geospatial data, especially for developing parts of the globe. QGIS provides some great plugins for subsetting and downloading from OSM. You can also add your own data to OSM. THat's the whole idea!

#### Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Task Manager  
[tasks.hotosm.org  ](http://tasks.hotosm.org/)  

OSM Tasking Manager is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OSM Team collaborative mapping. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping job into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated.

The application is an integral part of the work that the OpenStreetMap community does to respond to, and prepare for disasters, with geospatial data. 

#### DavidRumsey.com

#### Geonames.org
[www.geonames.org](http://www.geonames.org)
The GeoNames geographical database covers all countries and contains over eleven million placenames that are available for download free of charge. Also includes a geocoding service/API with very liberal use terms. 

#### Google Earth Engine
[https://earthengine.google.com/#intro](https://earthengine.google.com/#intro)  
Google Earth Engine combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface.
